# MyFileSystem

A course assignment

A UnixV6-like file system

Designed by Mo and Wang

* The compile instruction: `clang++ src/*.cpp -o MyFileSystem`

* The normal use of 'tree' command requires 
the terminal to be set to the utf8 character set
instead of gbk or gb2312 character set. 
Or you could modify the code about 'tree' command

* The inode of the filesystem has 6 direct pointers, 
2 single indirect pointers, and 2 double indirect pointers

* The blocks of the disk 
(i.e. the disk emulated by a large file in the physical machine) 
is managed by **group link method**.

* This filesystem has a caching machanism.
